Hi there! 
- I love doing analytical work on urgent and meaningful problems of today.    
- I have training in Math and Economics (University of Rochester, BA) and Biostatistics (Harvard, MS). 
- I have work experience in economic consulting, data science, and clinical research.
- I love running, reading, writing, podcasts, and I try to expose myself to new ideas regularly.
- Work is important to me! I hope to make a positive impact on the world while I am here, and work is a great organizing force to faciliate this goal.
